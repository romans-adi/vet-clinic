<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites

1. To install PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

Determine the appropriate installation method for your operating system. PostgreSQL supports various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Visit the PostgreSQL website to find the installation method specific to your OS.

1. For Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql
```

or

```
sudo yum install postgresql-server
```

or

```
sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
```

Other distributions: Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation or consult your distribution's documentation for installation instructions.

2. For Windows:

PostgreSQL Installer for Windows: Download the PostgreSQL Installer for Windows from the official website and run the installer. Follow the prompts and choose the components you want to install.

3. For macOS

Homebrew: If you have Homebrew installed, use the following command:

```
brew install postgresql
```

PostgreSQL for macOS: Download the PostgreSQL package for macOS from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

During the installation process, you may be prompted to provide a password for the default PostgreSQL superuser (postgres). Choose a strong password and remember it for future use.
After the installation is complete, PostgreSQL should be up and running as a service on your system. You can start and stop the service using the provided tools or by using the system services manager.

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you can access it using the psql command-line tool or a graphical client.

### Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

```
cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory
```

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

```
git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/vet-clinic.git
```

Using HTTPS:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/vet-clinic.git
```

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/vet-clinic.git vet-clinic
```

### Usage

To create the PostgreSQL database and view its contents, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system and the PostgreSQL server is running.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to create the database:

```
psql -U <username> -c "CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;"
```

Replace <username> with your PostgreSQL username and <database_name> with the desired name for your database.

4. To view the contents of the database, use the following command:

```
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -c "SELECT * FROM <table_name>;"
```

Replace <username> with your PostgreSQL username, <database_name> with the name of your database, and <table_name> with the name of the table you want to view.
